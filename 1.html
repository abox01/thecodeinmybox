<h2>after hours</h2>
<p>"After Hours" is a 1969 song written by Lou Reed[2] and originally performed by the Velvet Underground. It is the tenth and final track on their self-titled third album.[3] It is one of few songs with lead vocals by drummer Maureen Tucker, as Lou Reed stated the song was "so innocent and pure" that he could not possibly sing it himself. Tucker's vocals are accompanied by acoustic and bass guitar. The style of the lyrics and the music is somewhat reminiscent of Tin Pan Alley songs of the 1930s.[4]</p>
